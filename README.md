# Simple Real-Time Weather App

A cross-platform mobile app built with **React Native** and **Expo** for real-time weather, AI-generated weather facts, and cloud classification, powered by OpenWeather and Google's Gemini API. The backend is a **Flask** server that handles user management, push notifications, and AI integration.

---

## Features

-  **Current Weather:** Get real-time weather for any city using OpenWeather API.
-  **Forecast:** View weather forecasts and history.
-  **Cloud Classifier:** Upload or take a photo of clouds and get AI-based classification and rainfall prediction.
-  **AI Weather Facts:** Discover interesting weather facts generated by Gemini.
-  **Push Notifications:** Receive daily weather notifications at local morning time.
-  **User Profile:** Save your username, city, and notification preferences.
-  **Cross-Platform:** Works on Android and iOS (Expo/React Native).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** and **npm** (or **yarn**) and **npx**
- **Python 3.8+**
- **Expo CLI** (`npm install -g expo-cli`)
- **Expo Go App** (if you want to run the app locally)
- **EAS CLI** (`npm install -g eas-cli`)
- **Google account** (for the Gemini API key)
- **OpenWeather account** (for the OpenWeather API key)

---

### 1. Clone the Repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/simple-real-time-weather-app.git
cd simple-real-time-weather-app
```
---
### 2. Configure API Keys and Server IP

Edit the `constants.json` file in **both** the `backend` and `frontend` folders to include your API keys and server IP address:

```json
{
  "OPENWEATHER_API_KEY": "your_openweather_api_key",
  "GEMINI_API_KEY": "your_gemini_api_key",
  "SERVER_IP": "your_server_ip"
}
```

---

### 3. Backend Setup

```sh
cd backend
# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirement.txt

# Start the Flask server
python server.py
```

Since **Gemini 2.0 Flash and Gemini 2.0 Flash Preview Image Generation models are only available in a few countries**, you may need to use a VPN to host your server if your country is not supported.  

Please check the [Gemini API available regions](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/available-regions) and [Gemini 2.0 Flash Preview Image Generation model availability](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/models#gemini-2.0-flash-preview-image-generation) for more details before hosting the server.

---

### 4. Frontend Setup

```sh
cd ../frontend
# Install JS dependencies
npm install
```

---

### 5. Generate Your Own Expo Project Configuration

After installing dependencies in the `frontend` folder, you should generate your own Expo project configuration.  
This will create a unique Expo project ID and avoid conflicts with the original project.

```sh
# In frontend/
eas init
```

This command will guide you through setting up your own Expo project and update `app.json` as needed.  
**Tip:** You can also edit `app.json` to set your own app name, icon, and Android package name.

---

### 6. Run the project in a local environment

After setting up your Expo project, you can start the app locally and view it on your device using the Expo Go app:

```sh
# In frontend/
npx expo start -c
```

- In the terminal, you will then see a QR code.
- Click s to switch to the one for Expo Go.
- Scan the QR code with the [Expo Go app](https://expo.dev/client) on your Android or the camera on your iOS device to run the app instantly.

---

## Configuration

- **API Keys:**  
  Place your OpenWeather and Gemini API keys in both `backend/constants.json` and `frontend/constants.json`.
- **Server IP:**  
  Set your backend server's IP in both config files as `"SERVER_IP"`.

## Troubleshooting

- If you see missing package errors, run `npm install` or `expo install <package>`.
- For Python errors, ensure all dependencies in `requirement.txt` are installed.
- For push notifications, ensure you are using a real device and have granted notification permissions.
